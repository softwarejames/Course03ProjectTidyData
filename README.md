### run_analysis.R
* reads: activity_labels.txt, features.txt, subject_test.txt, subject_train.txt, X_test.txt, X_train.txt, y_test.txt, y_train.txt.

* combines these data sets into a single data set for body acceleration signal mean and standard deviation, tBodyAcc.mean and tBodyAcc.std, for x-y-z axis e.g. ...X to denote x-axis

* outputs: tidy2_data.txt for averaged acceleration signal mean and standard deviation values grouped by activity and subject

### tidy2_data.txt
averaged acceleration signal mean and standard deviation values grouped by activity and subject

### CodeBook.md
codebook outlining the original Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset, input files used, variables in the output file, and transformations performed for Tidy2 (tidy2_data.txt) output files
